                question="How does the Text2Card card maker generate random layouts?"
                answer="Our card maker uses a combination of AI algorithms and design principles to create random layouts.

                question="Can I create cards with consistent paragraph sizes using your card maker?"
                answer="Yes, our card maker allows you to maintain consistent paragraph sizes if desired. While we encourage embracing the randomness, we understand some projects need uniformity. To keep paragraphs the same size, simply use single line breaks between paragraphs when creating your card. For new layout variations, use double line breaks. This gives you the flexibility to balance between random creativity and structured design."
